Hi, I'm @lolivsodre, a data-driven explorer passionate about uncovering the stories behind human behavior. My journey has taken me from the depths of psychology to the fascinating world of data science, where I recently completed my certifications in 2022. I'm particularly intrigued by the ethical implications of Big Data and the captivating interplay between machine learning and psychology.  

Currently, I'm delving into the application of data science within the fashion industry, a realm bursting with potential for positive change. I'm currently researching and developing a thesis for my Master's application, focusing on one of these captivating areas. 

I'm always eager to collaborate on research papers and projects that merge data science with psychology and fashion – or all three! If you share my passion for exploring these intersections, please feel free to connect!
