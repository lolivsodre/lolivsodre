Hi, I’m @lolivsodre. I recently finish my Data Science and Analysis certifications in 2022.
From Psychology to Data Science, I am curious about human behavior through Big Data and its ethics. 
The contributions of Machine Learning to Psychology and vice versa is also one of my favorito study topics.
The use of Data Science in Fashion Industry is another subjetc I am very interest in.
I’m currently learning about those subjects and elaborating a thesis for a Master's application on one of those topics.
I’m looking to collaborate on scientific papers for publications and projects that combine Data Science with Psychology and Fashion (or both!)
